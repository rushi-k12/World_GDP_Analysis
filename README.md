## Overview
The World GDP Prediction project leverages machine learning to forecast GDP values based on historical data. It includes a predictive model trained on merged economic datasets and a Streamlit web application (app.py) for easy user interaction.

## Files Included
app.py: Streamlit web application for GDP predictions.
World_GDP.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
gdp_forecast_model.pkl: Serialized machine learning model (Python pickle format).
merged_data.csv: Dataset containing merged economic indicators used for training and predictions.
requirements.txt: Python dependencies required to run the application.

## Usage
Once the Streamlit app is running (streamlit run app.py), open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501 (or the address provided by Streamlit).
Enter a query or select options to predict GDP values based on the trained model.
